Quick start:

install msys and mingw, with at least the following extra packages:
- mingw32-make, tar, bzip2, xz, flex, bison, patch, wget, gawk
- install Python 2.7 32 bits (for clang and GDB python support)
- install Python 3.4 (for apt-get.py, for LZMA support in tar module)
- make sure Python 2.7 is in the path when building
- make sure to use Python 3.4 for apt-get.py\


How to use:
Install a sysroot:

pushd pc-linux-gnu/sysroot
[edit etc/apt/conf to use your favourite distribution and version]
python3 apt-get.py update
python3 apt-get.py install libc6-dev libc6-dev:i386 linux-libc-dev linux-libc-dev:i386 [extra dev packages]
popd

Download and build GCC/clang:
. python3 make.py [list of packages]

The compilers are built "relocatable" and placed in pc-linux-gnu, the whole directory can be
moved to a more convenient location.
